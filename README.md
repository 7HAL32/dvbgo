## dvbgo

An unofficial go package giving you a few options to query a collection of publicly accessible API methods for Dresden's public transport system.

In case you're looking for something like this for other languages, check out the versions for [node](https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbjs) and [python](https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbpy).

**dvbgo is WIP and not even close to something usable at the moment. I'm also just playing around with go using this as my advanced hello-world example and learning as I go. No pun intended.**

```go
import "github.com/kiliankoe/dvbgo"
```

Rest of the docs will follow as this starts to form ðŸ™ƒ
